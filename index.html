      <h1>LIQUIDATORS OF CHERNOBYL (the game)</h1>
      <p>This game is based on the people who were responsible for cleaning high-radiation radioactive waste from one of the roofs adjacent to the core number 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The liquidators had a maximum exposure time so they could only spend very little time doing the work of returning the waste to the core. This Roof (called Masha) was declared as the deadliest place on Earth. So if they were exposed too long, they could die.</p>
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>Collect all radioactive material and take it to the core. You can only carry one residue in the shovel at a time. If while the shovel is loaded, you step on another residue, your Geiger counter will warn you that you are losing life. Once you have collected all the debris and returned to the core, you must exit through the safe zone to complete the game. During the process there will be powerups that will help you get it as well as coins that will add more points to the player. There will also be radioactive enemies such as nuclear Zombies and radioactive spiders that if they touch you, will make you lose life.
        In two-player mode, there will be a competition between the two to see who collects the most waste in a given time. At the end of the game, the most points earned will win.</p>
